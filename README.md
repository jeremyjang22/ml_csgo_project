for csv/image results see: 
  - /CSVS for output csvs for testing/training accuracy
  - /Graphs for output charts

For each approach (Logistic regression/ Support Vector Machine/ Neural Network), see:
  - 'Logistic Regression Implementation.ipynb'
  - 'SVM_implementation_3-7_polynomial_kernel_test.ipynb' (note the code is the same for 'SVM_implementation.ipynb' but has the testing for higher order polynomials)
  - 'Neural Networks Implementation.ipynb'
